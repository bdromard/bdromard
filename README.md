# About me

I am a software developer at [Hubblo](https://hubblo.org), working mostly on [`carenage`](https://gitlab.com/hubblo/carenage) and [`boagent`](https://github.com/boavizta/boagent). 
I was previously an historian, specialized in the history of Ancient Mesopotomia. I studied slavery and other forms of forced labour in first millennium BCE Babylonia for my PhD dissertation, and other subjects later on (fiscality, material culture).

Presently, my main learning interests are Rust & functional programming, Internet infrastructures, operating systems (mainly Linux). 
Anything related to the interactions between society, politics, and tech also interest me.
