<h1>Welcome !</h1>

I was previously an historian, specialized in the history of Ancient Mesopotomia.
<br>I am now switching carreers and have started training in programming at <a url="https://adatechschool.fr/">Ada Tech School</a> since January 2023.
<br>As of January 2024, I have started an apprenticeship as a developer at <a url="https://hubblo.org/">Hubblo</a>.
<br>
<br>My main learning interests at the moment are OCaml and Rust, Internet infrastructures, and operating systems (mainly Linux).
<br>You will find here my different projects & exercises made during my training.
