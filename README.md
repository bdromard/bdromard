<h1>Welcome !</h1>

I was previously an historian, specialized in the history of Ancient Mesopotomia.
<br>I am now switching carreers and have started training in programming at <a url="https://adatechschool.fr/">Ada Tech School</a> since January 2023.
<br>My main learning interests at the moment are back-end programming, Internet infrastructures, Linux, and DevOps tools and methods.
<br>You will find here my different projects & exercises made during my training.

<br>I am looking for an apprenticeship of 12 months as a DevOps or as a backend developer, starting from October 2023 in Paris.
